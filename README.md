I'm √Ålvaro, just a passionate **Software Engineer**, but I have a great story to tell you about my professional path. Let's take a look!

#### GFT Technologies SE
> *Since February 2023*

I'm currently working at [**GFT Technologies SE**](https://www.gft.com/) as a **Backend Engineer** and I'm so happy to be rounded by a very warm and friendly **international environment**. I'm assigned to a private banking project, developing a trade finance platform on microservices and built in Java and Spring, some of my responsibilities here are
- Be part of the **analysis, design and development** phases of the new incoming functionalities of the platform
- Integrate **IBM MQ / Kafka** event streaming platforms
- Onboard new services into **Google Cloud Platform (GCP)** 
- Develop test modules following the *testing pyramid model*, which includes **unit testing**, **integration testing** and **end-to-end testing**

I also learned a lot since I'm working here, for example I learned
- To integrate **Terraform** with **Google Cloud Platform (GCP)** following the architecture as a code principle
- To develop build and deployment pipelines using **GitHub Workflows** where also SDLC controls were integrated into them
- To build tests using **Serenity** and **Cucumber** in a **behavior-riven development (BDD)** way

Lastly, I enforced my skills in
- Coding following high quality standards, backed by **SOLID** principles and good implementation of design patters
- Developing clean code working with **checkstyle**, **PMD**, **CPD**, **Spot bug**s and **SonarQube**
